        "\n",
        "The mean is highly sensitive to outliers. In a dataset like income, a few billionaires can drag the mean significantly higher than what a \"typical\" person earns. The median is the middle value and remains robust against these extremes, providing a more realistic \"typical\" value to fill in the gaps.\n",

        "Forward fill (ffill) carries the last known non-null value forward to replace the subsequent missing value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: It is most useful in Time-Series data. For example, if a stock price is recorded every minute but the value for 10:01 AM is missing, it is logical to assume it is the same as the 10:00 AM price until a new change is recorded.\n",

        "Flagging involves creating a new binary column (e.g., is_income_missing) before you fill the hole with a mean or median.\n",
        "\n",
        "It preserves the information that a value was originally missing. This allows downstream models to \"learn\" if the absence of data itself is a pattern, and it prevents the imputed values from being indistinguishable from actual observed values.\n",
